%description
FastTracker 2 is a music tracker created by Fredrik "Mr. H" Huss and Magnus "Vogue" HÃ¶gdahl, two members of the demogroup Triton
(who later founded Starbreeze Studios) which set about releasing their own tracker after breaking into the scene in 1992 and winning several demo competitions.
The source code of FastTracker 2 is written in Pascal using Borland Pascal 7 and TASM. The program works natively under MS-DOS.
